Currently, itâ€™s hard to find the best price as liquidity is fragmented over the whole DEX market. Tokenlon solves this by aggregating multiple liquidity sources, including professional market makers off-chain and automatic market makers (such as Uniswap, Curve) on-chain, automatically selecting the best trading venue for the user.

Staked users get discounts on transactions, promoting staking of the LON.

Increasing APY on staking LON tokens. 42% presently. Not great. Price is $2.

NO ROADMAP. Some updates here: https://support.tokenlon.im/hc/en-us/articles/4409841439892-Tokenlon-Weekly-2021-10-29-2021-11-05-

Seems transparent with what they are working on.

Don't really see anything to get excited about yet.
